# Deploying a fully responsive frontend website for an educational insitute using Docker

🌐 Project Overview
This capstone project is a fully responsive, front-end website developed for an educational institution. It is based on a professionally designed template sourced from Envato Elements, which was customized and extended using modern front-end technologies including HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript.

🐳 Capstone Project: Containerizing a Static Website with Docker

🧭 Project Overview
This capstone project involves containerizing a static educational website (based on an HTML/CSS/SASS/JS template from Envato Elements) using Docker. The primary goal is to gain hands-on experience with building, running, and managing containerized front-end applications.

🎓 What You'll Learn

✅ 1. Docker Fundamentals
Writing a Dockerfile to containerize a static web app using a lightweight web server (e.g., Nginx or httpd).
Understanding base images, COPY, WORKDIR, and EXPOSE directives.

✅ 2. Docker Image Creation
Building custom images for front-end deployment.
Optimizing image size and structure for production.

✅ 3. Serving Static Content with Nginx
Configuring Nginx in a container to serve HTML, CSS, and JS assets.
Adding a custom nginx.conf file to control routing, caching, and error handling.

✅ 4. Docker Volumes (Optional Enhancement)
Using bind mounts or named volumes to live-reload content during development.

✅ 5. Docker Compose (Optional for Extension)
Adding Docker Compose to manage Nginx + potential extensions (e.g., analytics or form backend stubs) with one command.

✅ 6. Deployment Readiness
Testing and running the container locally (docker run).
Tagging and pushing to Docker Hub.
